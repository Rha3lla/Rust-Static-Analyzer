This file defines explicit mappings between HA-RUST rules and MISRA guidelines that are
applicable to Rust. The tool uses these mappings for compliance reporting and filtering. 

IMPORTANT:
- This file does not reproduce MISRA content.
- MISRA references are recorded as identifiers/labels only.
- Exact MISRA refs are marked <TBD> until validated against the licensed source.
